# pcf-bidirectional
Simple implementation of a typechecker and evaluator for PCF (Programming Computable Functions). PCF is a typed functional programming language with support for natural numbers and general recursion, whose type system is very similar to that of the simply typed lambda calculus. The typechecker makes use of bidirectional typechecking, which only has limited ability to infer types, and therefore type annotations are often required.
